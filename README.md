# Tambola

Getting Started

1. This project is built using gradle, so install gradle and ensure that gradle is in your path.
2. Use gradle eclipse, to generate the eclipse projects.
3. Use gradle build to run the tests and generate coverage

Known Issues
1. The build fails in travis with a PersistenceUnitLoadingException, need to fix that. So unfortunately no build passing badge and no code coverage badge until then :( Please reach out, if you can fix it.

Next Steps
1. I am looking to build a REST wrapper for the code. Contributions are welcome.
